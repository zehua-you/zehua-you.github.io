          When I have some free time, I enjoyed music and philosophy the most.
          Somehow I think music is bridging between my logical self and my emotional world.
          Philosophy allows me see the world that I may never experience.

          I like singing and have practiced formal vocal training. My voice part is tenor,
          and I enjoy music that lets me explore both technique and emotion. Music helps me
          navigate the tension between structure and feeling, and it brings clarity when life
          becomes noisy.

          I’m drawn to philosophy that deals with complexity, ambiguity, and how people make sense
          of the world—especially questions about meaning, structure, and everyday life. I read
          philosophy not to escape reality, but to understand it more carefully.
