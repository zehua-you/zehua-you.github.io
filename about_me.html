        <h3>Current Self</h3>
        <p>
            Hi, welcome to my personal website again!!
            My name is Zehua You. I am a current student at Swarthmore College, 
            majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Sociology.<br> 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a lot of interests and hobbies. I like reading books, especially literature and philosophy texts.
            Literature allows me to get lost in stories and stepping into the world that
            I will never have the chance to explore in my life. Philosophy invites me
            to ponder deeply and understand why I am doing something before I do it.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I also enjoy music and singing when I am free because I think music helps me connect
            the gap between logic and emotions.
        </p>
        <h3>Future Self</h3>
        <p>
            In the future, I imagine myself working on some start-up projects. I will sit inside some office
            building and presenting the mechanisms behind a product that I am working on to a group of investers. 
            I will have to travel around because collaborators and clients are spread around the world. It will
            be a very busy time, but I enjoy the process because I think I am learning new things and taking on
            new challenges every day.
        </p>
